## Install

This project uses NodeJS. The required version of node is documented in the `package.json`. We recommend installing a tool for managing versions of node on your development machine. Several of our contributors use [nvm](https://nvm.sh), though our project does not require it.

Follow these steps to set up the project on a new development machine. Instructions assume you have cloned the repository locally, have the proper version of node set up, and are in the root directory of the project.

1. Install yarn packages

```$shell
yarn install
```
